# The Benchmark

This is the documentation for the Scandinavian Embedding Benchmark. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the sentence/documents embeddings of large language models.

Intended uses for this benchmark:

- Evaluating document embeddings of Scandinavian language models
- Evaluating document embeddings for multilingual models on Scandinavian languages
- Allow ranking of competing Scandinavian and multilingual models using no more compute that what a consumer laptop can provide

## Comparison to other benchmarks

If you use this benchmark for a relative ranking of language models you should also take a look at ScandEval, which as opposed the this benchmark fully fine-tunes the models. It also includes structures predictions tasks such as named entity recognition. 

This tasks within this benchmark is also included in the MTEB leaderboard, though the aggregations methods very slightly. The MTEB is primarily an English benchmark, with a few multilingual tasks along with a few additional languages. As a part of this project the tasks was also added to the MTEB leaderboard.
